- WHEN a filter is applied, THEN the selected filter button SHALL be visually highlighted

#### 3.2.2 Task Search
**User Story**: As a user, I want to search for specific tasks so that I can quickly find items in a long list.

**Acceptance Criteria** (EARS format):
- WHEN the user types in the search box, THEN tasks SHALL be filtered in real-time to show only matching results
- WHEN the search query matches task text, THEN matching tasks SHALL be highlighted
- WHEN the search box is empty, THEN all tasks (respecting current filter) SHALL be displayed
